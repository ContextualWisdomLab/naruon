"""CardDAV base-URL auto-discovery (RFC 6764).

Resolution order for an email address or bare domain:

1. ``https://<domain>/.well-known/carddav`` -- follow the well-known redirect
   to the context path advertised by the provider.
2. DNS SRV ``_carddavs._tcp.<domain>`` (TLS), combined with the RFC 6764
   Section 6 TXT ``path`` hint when present. Plain ``_carddav._tcp`` records
   advertise a non-TLS service; contacting one would send credentials in the
   clear, so they are detected and refused rather than silently upgraded.

Every candidate host is SSRF-guarded exactly like the existing DAV code: the
scheme must be https, userinfo/query/fragment are rejected, and the host must
resolve to globally-routable addresses (no localhost / private / link-local).
The well-known probe is DNS-pinned via ``pinned_request_target`` so validation
and connection use the same resolution.

The helper is fully injectable for tests: pass ``http_client_factory`` (an
httpx-style async client), ``srv_resolver`` (returns SRV records ordered per
RFC 2782 priority/weight), and ``txt_resolver`` (returns TXT record strings)
to avoid real network or DNS. DNS support is best-effort -- if no resolver is
supplied and ``dnspython`` is not installed, only the well-known probe runs.
