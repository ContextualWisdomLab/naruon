"""Fusion functions for hybrid (lexical + semantic) retrieval.

Default strategy: convex combination of theoretically min-max
normalized channel scores ("TM2C2", Bruch, Gai & Ingber 2023,
ACM TOIS 42(1), arXiv:2210.11934). Their analysis shows TM2C2
outperforms Reciprocal Rank Fusion in- and out-of-domain, is robust
for alpha in [0.6, 0.8] without training data, and — unlike RRF —
preserves the score distribution (Lipschitz continuity).

Reciprocal Rank Fusion (Cormack, Clarke & Büttcher 2009, SIGIR)
is retained as the non-parametric alternative for channels that only
produce ranks (future learned-sparse or external channels), selected
via ``FusionSettings.strategy_name``.

Both channel scores used here have *theoretical* bounds, so no
per-query data-dependent normalization is needed:

- pg_trgm ``word_similarity``            -> [0.0, 1.0]
- pgvector cosine distance (``<=>``)     -> [0.0, 2.0]
