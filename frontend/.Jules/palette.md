## 2026-06-04 - Add loading state to SearchLayout button
**Learning:** Users notice the little things. Missing loading states on async actions makes users unsure if their action registered. Adding a simple loading spinner provides immediate feedback and aligns with accessibility best practices when making dynamic state changes.
**Action:** Always include a visual loading state like `Loader2` for async actions (like the '발신자 관계 캡처' button) to provide immediate feedback to the user.

## 2024-06-07 - Refactoring CalendarLayout buttons
**Learning:** Raw HTML `<button>` elements with complex Tailwind class strings were scattered throughout layout components, which led to inconsistent hover, focus-visible states, and accessibility properties compared to standard design system components.
**Action:** Replace raw HTML `<button>` tags with the `@/components/ui/button` `Button` component using appropriate variants (`ghost`, `outline`) and sizes (`icon-sm`, `sm`) to instantly standardize accessible focus rings and interaction feedback.

## 2026-06-08 - WorkspaceHome unused import investigation
**Learning:** Investigating unused import reports should first verify the current file because the codebase may already have evolved. The repo lint entrypoint is `eslint`, and the focused check for this investigation was `npx eslint src/components/WorkspaceHome.tsx`.
**Action:** Use the focused `npx eslint src/components/WorkspaceHome.tsx` check when confirming WorkspaceHome import health, and reserve broader `eslint` runs for full frontend lint validation.

## 2026-06-08 - Accessible Tooltips on Disabled Buttons
**Learning:** Adding a `title` tooltip directly to a natively `disabled` `<button>` does not work well because disabled buttons are removed from the tab order and ignore pointer events on many platforms, making the tooltip inaccessible to both keyboard-only users and screen readers.
**Action:** When a disabled button needs a tooltip to explain *why* it is disabled, wrap the button in an accessible container (e.g., `span` or `div` with `tabIndex={0}`), expose the explanation through `aria-describedby`, and keep `title` as a pointer fallback. Also, ensure the button uses `pointer-events-none` so the wrapper can properly catch the hover events.

## 2026-06-09 - Accessible Tooltips on Disabled Buttons (Update)
**Learning:** Adding a wrapper `span` with `tabIndex={0}` to hold the tooltip for a disabled button creates an extra, non-semantic DOM node that may confuse screen readers, especially if it doesn't have an interactive role.
**Action:** Instead of wrapping a `<button disabled>` in a `span`, use a single `<button>` with `aria-disabled="true"`. This keeps the button in the natural tab order, allows `aria-describedby` to work properly on the element itself, and tooltips can be applied without extra wrappers. Make sure to manually handle the disabled state guard (early return) in the `onClick` event handler and apply styling using `aria-disabled:opacity-50` instead of `disabled:opacity-50`.
