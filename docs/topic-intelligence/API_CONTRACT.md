# Planned topic-inference API contract

- **Capability maturity:** `BLOCKED-UPSTREAM`
- **Document status:** `PRESENT-CURRENT`
- **Contract version:** `topic-inference-result-v1`
- **Contract revision:** `2026-08-09.1`

There is no shipped topic-inference endpoint in Naruon today. This document
defines the Naruon-side contract that may be implemented only after TEPP
independently publishes a compatible production fitted-model artifact and
inference boundary with its own acceptance evidence.

## Contract layers

Three representations must not be conflated:

1. **Authenticated Naruon API.** A browser or API client submits opaque source
   references. Naruon reauthorizes and resolves server-authoritative evidence.
2. **Internal Naruon adapter envelope.** Naruon binds an immutable snapshot,
   schema/deployment pins, sensitive canonical digests, error mapping, and
   scientific acceptance policy. The result schema in this package applies to
   this internal envelope.
3. **Expected upstream scientific payload.** Naruon expects the independently
   accepted producer to own fitted-model inference evidence nested under
   `tepp_payload`. TEPP is only the expected producer if it separately publishes
   a compatible production contract and accepts that responsibility; this local
   schema does not assign it or claim adoption.

The authenticated API returns a redacted projection of the internal envelope.
Sensitive digests, tenant/workspace bindings, covariate values, design rows, and
raw evidence locations must not cross the public boundary.

## Planned endpoint

`POST /api/topic-intelligence/inferences`

The route is private and signed-session authenticated. Its final implementation
must scope every lookup by the authenticated owner, organization, and workspace.
Elevated platform roles do not automatically become the mailbox/document owner.

### Request

```json
{
  "document_ref": "doc_Q7mWQVp1jJHq5J3e",
  "evidence_ref": "ev_q9BH7d4eMG3A2x6n",
  "request_revision": "reqrev_01",
  "idempotency_key": "a-client-generated-bounded-opaque-value",
  "expected_snapshot_revision": "snaprev_184",
  "language": "ko-KR",
  "purpose": "topic_assistance"
}
```

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `document_ref` | Opaque source identifier. It is not a database primary key, provider message ID, URL, or path. |
| `evidence_ref` | Opaque, audience-bound, snapshot-bound, tenant/workspace-bound, expiring capability reference. Naruon reauthorizes it at use time and never dereferences client-controlled URLs or paths. |
| `request_revision` | Bounded opaque revision used for optimistic request compatibility. Reusing it for different canonical content is a conflict. |
| `idempotency_key` | Bounded opaque client token. Naruon stores/compares only a protected tenant-keyed representation; reuse with a different canonical request returns `409`. |
| `expected_snapshot_revision` | Optional optimistic pin. The route compares it with the newly authorized server snapshot; mismatch returns `409`. |
| `language` | Required BCP 47 tag selected or confirmed by the caller. A homemade keyword/script detector must not silently override it. Model support is checked during preflight. |
| `purpose` | Must equal an allowlisted, consented purpose. Revision `2026-08-09.1` defines only `topic_assistance`. |

The public request never contains raw email/document content, topic labels,
tenant identifiers, model display names, covariate values, membership labels,
or upstream endpoints. Naruon derives the canonical internal request from the
reauthorized snapshot and active deployment.

### Successful public projection

HTTP `200` has exactly two semantic states:

- `inferred`: an accepted mixed-membership posterior is available;
- `abstained`: compatible input and model reached inference, but the attempted
  posterior or a declared diagnostic/acceptance rule declined publication.

```json
{
  "request_id": "tir_3FQn1v8H2zK6cP4m",
  "status": "inferred",
  "model_id": "opaque-versioned-model-id",
  "model_version": "opaque-versioned-model-ref",
  "analysis_context": {
    "analysis_unit": "document",
    "estimand_id": "document_topic_mixture",
    "causal_design": "non_causal",
    "covariate_level": "analysis_unit"
  },
  "credible_level": 0.95,
  "interval_method": "upstream-declared-method",
  "uncertainty_scope": "conditional_on_fitted_artifact",
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic_id": 17,
      "rank": 1,
      "proportion": 0.62,
      "credible_interval": {"lower": 0.51, "upper": 0.72}
    },
    {
      "topic_id": 4,
      "rank": 2,
      "proportion": 0.38,
      "credible_interval": {"lower": 0.28, "upper": 0.49}
    }
  ],
  "diagnostic_status": "accepted",
  "completed_at": "2026-08-09T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Human-readable labels, if later exposed, use a separate `presentation` object
with their own version and evidence references. They do not replace `topic_id`
or alter posterior values.

An abstention has no usable topic components:

```json
{
  "request_id": "tir_B7p4K2m9Q5x1V8nD",
  "status": "abstained",
  "model_id": "opaque-versioned-model-id",
  "model_version": "opaque-versioned-model-ref",
  "analysis_context": {
    "analysis_unit": "document",
    "estimand_id": "document_topic_mixture",
    "causal_design": "non_causal",
    "covariate_level": "analysis_unit"
  },
  "credible_level": 0.95,
  "interval_method": "upstream-declared-method",
  "uncertainty_scope": "conditional_on_fitted_artifact",
  "topics": [],
  "diagnostic_status": "rejected",
  "abstention_reasons": ["posterior_uncertainty_exceeds_policy"],
  "completed_at": "2026-08-09T12:00:00Z"
}
```

The response must carry `Cache-Control: no-store`. The UI must render an
abstention as unavailable evidence, not as a zero-probability topic, successful
classification, or reason to invoke agenda generation.

`model_id`, `model_version`, and `analysis_context` are required safe semantic
context, not optional UI decoration. Consumers join numeric topic IDs only within
that model identity and must display/use the analysis unit, estimand, coarse
covariate level, and `non_causal` designation so group-level effects cannot be
presented as an individual's trait or causal outcome. No group value, membership
identifier, raw covariate, or sensitive digest is exposed.

## Internal adapter envelope

The internal response validates against
[`topic-inference-result-v1.schema.json`](schema/topic-inference-result-v1.schema.json),
whose immutable identifier is:

`https://naruon.net/schemas/topic-intelligence/topic-inference-result-v1/2026-08-09.1`

The adapter configuration pins both that `$id` and the SHA-256 digest of the RFC
8785 canonical schema document. A response repeats the ID, revision, and digest;
the schema intentionally does not embed its own expected digest because the pin
is distributed out of band.

The envelope is Naruon-owned and requires:

- opaque request, document, snapshot, expiring evidence-reference identity, and
  matching server-created snapshot/scope bindings;
- schema revision/digest and adapter version;
- source-snapshot and nested scientific-payload digests;
- the independently accepted expected-upstream scientific payload nested under
  `tepp_payload`, including all scientific provenance, design, posterior,
  uncertainty, and diagnostics fields; and
- optional versioned presentation labels outside the scientific payload.

The envelope and its digests are internal validation data. The public projection
above deliberately omits them.

## HTTP and abstention semantics

| HTTP | `error_code` or status | When it applies | Retry rule |
|---:|---|---|---|
| `200` | `inferred` | Compatible request, active verified deployment, valid payload, and accepted posterior/diagnostics | Normal result |
| `200` | `abstained` | Compatible request/model reached inference, but posterior uncertainty, diagnostics, or pinned publication policy rejected release | Do not retry unchanged input/model/policy |
| `401` | `topic_authentication_required` | No valid signed session or service identity is present | Authenticate; do not reveal resource existence |
| `403` | `topic_evidence_forbidden` | Evidence authorization fails for the current owner/tenant/workspace | Do not retry without a new authorization decision |
| `403` | `topic_purpose_forbidden`, `topic_consent_required`, `topic_region_forbidden` | Purpose, consent, or region policy denies processing | Policy/consent remediation; no upstream call |
| `409` | `topic_source_snapshot_conflict` | Expected and current authorized snapshot revisions differ | Refresh source state |
| `409` | `topic_request_revision_conflict` | A trusted request revision is incompatible with the canonical request | Create a new revision after refresh |
| `409` | `topic_idempotency_conflict` | An idempotency key was previously bound to different canonical request material | Use a new key only for a genuinely new operation |
| `409` | `topic_schema_revision_conflict` | Client/adapter revision pin conflicts with the active immutable contract | Negotiate a supported revision; never coerce |
| `408` | `topic_deadline_exceeded` | Naruon's bounded request budget expires before an upstream timeout can be classified | Retry only within bounded client policy |
| `422` | `topic_input_invalid` | Bounded shape or source snapshot cannot satisfy the inference request | Correct the request/source |
| `422` | `topic_language_unsupported` | Active fitted artifact does not support the declared language/profile | Select a compatible model only through deployment policy |
| `422` | `topic_input_insufficient_tokens` | Frozen preprocessing retains fewer tokens than the active threshold | More evidence is required |
| `422` | `topic_input_out_of_vocabulary` | OOV count/ratio violates the active artifact policy | Use compatible source evidence/model; no fallback |
| `422` | `topic_temporal_context_invalid` | Event, availability, assertion, or knowledge-cutoff evidence violates the temporal policy | Correct authoritative time evidence |
| `422` | `topic_covariate_contract_invalid` | Required covariate, level, membership weight, or design row is missing/incompatible | Correct authoritative covariate evidence |
| `429` | `topic_rate_limited` | Tenant/workspace quota, concurrency, or repeated-query policy denies work | Honor `Retry-After`; do not change measurement method |
| `503` | `topic_deployment_unavailable` | No verified active deployment exists | Retry only after operator activation |
| `503` | `topic_model_artifact_unavailable` | Pinned artifact or required retained manifest cannot be resolved | Operator/upstream remediation |
| `503` | `topic_model_artifact_integrity_failed` | Artifact/provenance digest validation fails | Quarantine deployment; do not retry blindly |
| `502` | `topic_upstream_inference_failed` | Compatible request reached the upstream boundary but transport/runtime failed | Retry according to bounded service policy |
| `502` | `topic_upstream_protocol_error` | Upstream response fails schema, digest, asserted date-time format, known code-registry, or cross-field validation | Quarantine/review; never turn into abstention |
| `504` | `topic_upstream_timeout` | The bounded expected-upstream deadline expires and work is cancelled | Retry only within bounded service policy |
| `500` | `topic_adapter_internal_error` | Unexpected Naruon defect after safe classification | Incident handling; no internal detail in response |

A client disconnect or explicit cancellation may make an HTTP response
impossible. The adapter must cancel bounded work, emit no result, and record only
the internal stable outcome `topic_request_cancelled` in approved redacted
telemetry. It must not serialize a partial posterior or retry after cancellation.

Authentication/authorization/purpose/consent/region denial, rate limiting,
unsupported language, token/OOV insufficiency, temporal/covariate incompatibility,
missing deployment/artifact, integrity failure, trusted conflicts, timeout,
cancellation, and upstream protocol failures must never return HTTP `200` or
`status=abstained`.
These error conditions must never return HTTP `200` or `status=abstained`.

## RFC 9457 problem details

Every non-`200` response uses `application/problem+json` and a stable RFC 9457
problem type. `error_code` is a required Naruon extension; clients branch on the
code, not on localized `title` or `detail` text.

```json
{
  "type": "https://naruon.net/problems/topic-language-unsupported",
  "title": "Topic inference language is unsupported",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "The active fitted model cannot infer this language profile.",
  "instance": "/api/topic-intelligence/inferences/tir_3FQn1v8H2zK6cP4m",
  "error_code": "topic_language_unsupported",
  "request_id": "tir_3FQn1v8H2zK6cP4m",
  "retryable": false
}
```

Problem responses must not include raw source content, topic candidates,
canonical digests, tenant/workspace IDs, covariates, membership identities,
upstream URLs, stack traces, provider errors, or arbitrary evidence references.

## Scientific payload requirements

The nested `tepp_payload` contains no presentation label. It must provide:

- fitted model ID/version/topic count;
- artifact, manifest, vocabulary, preprocessing, design, lineage, model-card,
  validation-report, evidence-time manifest, covariate snapshot, and design-row
  canonical digests;
- estimator, analysis unit, estimand, prevalence/content formulas, contrasts,
  versioned covariate schema, typed covariate level/missingness policy,
  membership structure/normalization, unseen-level policy, validation profile,
  temporal policy version, explicit document/event/assertion/availability/
  knowledge-cutoff time values, the pinned temporal missingness rule, an asserted
  availability-at-cutoff result, and `causal_design=non_causal`;
- inference method, implementation/version, numerical backend, credible level,
  interval method, and
  `uncertainty_scope=conditional_on_fitted_artifact`;
- non-negative integer topic IDs, ranks, proportions, and per-topic intervals for
  accepted results;
- input diagnostics for language, original/retained/OOV tokens and their pinned
  thresholds, temporal context, and covariates;
- posterior diagnostics with an immutable diagnostic-code registry version,
  convergence and its stable known code, numerical status, bounded stable known
  quality codes, iteration count, finite values, interval
  validity, observed component count, posterior sum, and normalization tolerance;
  and
- an acceptance-policy version, immutable reason-code registry version, boolean
  decision, and stable known reason codes.

The adapter recomputes and cross-checks unique topic IDs/ranks; for `inferred`,
equality of fitted, declared, observed, and actual component counts; sum,
interval containment, finite values, method copies, status, and diagnostic
consistency. It also checks request/evidence snapshot and scope-binding equality,
current tenant/workspace/purpose/consent/region authorization, input thresholds,
membership-structure/normalization coupling, typed covariate level/missingness,
RFC 3339 format assertion, and `availability_time <= knowledge_cutoff_time`.
Unknown code registry versions or codes and any failed cross-check are `502`
protocol errors. Schema validation alone is insufficient.

## Digest contract

The complete internal inventory is the schema, source snapshot, scientific
payload, artifact descriptor, artifact manifest, vocabulary, preprocessing,
design, lineage, model card, validation report, evidence-time manifest,
covariate snapshot, and design row. Every digest in the internal envelope is:

`SHA-256(UTF8(domain) || 0x00 || UTF8(RFC8785(value)))`

with lowercase hexadecimal output. Contract digests cover canonical JSON
descriptors; an upstream manifest may additionally carry a raw-byte artifact
hash. RFC 8785 does not normalize Unicode, so normalization belongs only to the
pinned preprocessing contract.

The no-covariate canonical representations are fixed:

- `{"covariates":[],"memberships":[]}` under
  `naruon.topic-inference.covariate-snapshot.v1`;
- `{"columns":[],"values":[]}` under
  `tepp.topic-measurement.design-row.v1`.

A digest verifies retained material but cannot reconstruct it. Reproduction
requires the authorized source snapshot and every pinned model, vocabulary,
preprocessing, design, lineage, temporal, covariate, and design-row object to
remain resolvable under retention policy.

All content-, evidence-, covariate-, membership-, temporal-, design-, and
label-derived digests are sensitive pseudonymous linkage data. They are never
public and never appear in ordinary logs, metrics, traces, or audit events. A
restricted audit record may be referenced only by a tenant-keyed opaque handle.

## Evidence reference rules

An `evidence_ref`:

- is opaque and contains no source/provider identifier, URL, or path;
- is bound to one audience, tenant, workspace, document snapshot, and purpose;
- has an expiry and is rejected when expired;
- is reauthorized on every use instead of treated as a bearer shortcut;
- cannot be exchanged across organizations or workspaces; and
- resolves only through a server-side registry that returns the retained
  immutable snapshot or fails closed.

The internal `evidence_ref.snapshot_revision` must equal
`request.source_snapshot_revision`, and its `scope_binding_ref` must equal the
request binding. Resolution must reproduce the current authenticated tenant,
workspace, purpose, consent, region, and authorization binding; equality of the
opaque strings alone is insufficient.

## Compatibility and change control

Revision `2026-08-09.1` is immutable. Backward-compatible clarifications require
a new revision and schema digest; semantic changes to topic identity,
uncertainty, abstention, provenance, error mapping, or ownership require a new
contract version and a superseding Naruon ADR. Naruon must not silently coerce a
expected-upstream payload from an unrecognized revision.

No route can move from `BLOCKED-UPSTREAM` to implemented until the requirements
and evidence in [Traceability](TRACEABILITY.md) and the operability/security
gates are satisfied on the exact candidate revision.
