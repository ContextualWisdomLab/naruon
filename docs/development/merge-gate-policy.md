# Merge Gate Policy

This repository's merge gate is evidence-based: required checks must pass,
review threads must be resolved, and the current PR head must have current-head
CodeRabbit or structured OpenCode App robot-review evidence. Human review is not
awaited by default.

## Required gate contract

- Required status checks must pass on the current head SHA.
- Application CI must run backend pytest and frontend test/lint/build checks on
  pull requests to `master` and `release/**`, while release-branch pushes must
  not create duplicate check noise; push checks are scoped to `master`.
- The robot-review gate prefers CodeRabbit evidence. When the current head has
  CodeRabbit check-run evidence, it satisfies the gate only when current-head
  blocking findings, warnings, and failures are fixed, rebutted with evidence,
  or superseded. Authoritative current-head `Review skipped` evidence satisfies
  that path only when applicable. When no CodeRabbit check-run exists, the gate
  waits for an exact-current-head `APPROVED` review from the `opencode-agent`
  GitHub App. The review body must name the head SHA and include structured
  adversarial validation with `status=passed` and at least two probes whose
  outcome is `falsified`. Stale-head reviews, `github-actions` reviews, and
  insufficient probe evidence do not satisfy the gate.
- PR Governance automation is metadata-only: it must not checkout pull request
  code, clone the head branch, dismiss reviews, enable auto-merge, or use admin
  merge. It may read PR/check/review-thread metadata and post blocker comments;
  the separate human/agent landing path performs any allowed merge action after
  current-head gates are satisfied. Submitted and dismissed review events rerun
  the metadata controller so OpenCode App evidence updates the gate promptly.
- PR Governance runs trusted-base logic only. The workflow materializes the base
  repository script from a trusted tarball and must not execute PR-head scripts.
  Trusted tarball materialization uses bounded retry plus archive validation for
  transient GitHub API truncation and fails closed instead of falling back to
  PR-head or local scripts.
- Pending, queued, requested, waiting, or in-progress checks are wait states, not
  hard failure findings. Success, pass, skipped, and neutral states satisfy the
  gate. Every other required-check state — including failed, cancelled,
  timed-out, action-required, and any unrecognized state — is a blocker: the
  gate fails closed rather than passing states it does not understand.
- If gate evaluation itself errors (for example a transient GitHub API
  failure), the gate publishes a completed/failure check-run instead of leaving
  a previously published result in place.
- Gate blocker comments publish sanitized check names and generic error text
  only; raw CLI diagnostics stay in the workflow run log. Inside Actions the
  gate runs with a pinned system PATH so earlier steps cannot influence tool
  resolution via GITHUB_PATH.
- The trusted-base metadata gate validates the repository identity before
  constructing any GitHub API path and rejects malformed values without
  invoking `gh`; PR numbers remain positive decimal identifiers.
- Authoritative `Review skipped` evidence counts only when the same check
  output carries no blocking warning/failure language alongside it.
- `reviewDecision=CHANGES_REQUESTED` is a blocker until requested changes are
  addressed or superseded on the current head.
- Blocker comments use the idempotent
  `<!-- pr-governance:metadata-gate -->` marker and are patched in place instead
  of duplicated on repeated workflow events.
- GitHub rulesets must use `required_approving_review_count=0` so GitHub does
  not require a human `APPROVED` review when robot-review policy applies.
- GitHub rulesets must keep `required_review_thread_resolution=true`.
- CodeRabbit `request_changes_workflow` stays enabled so the robot can clear
  its own requested-changes review after comments are resolved. CodeRabbit
  GitHub Checks integration stays disabled because GitHub Actions are already
  evaluated by required checks and PR Governance; duplicating that gate inside
  CodeRabbit can strand stale GitHub `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review objects when an
  unrelated scanner is temporarily failing.
- Bypass actors must not be configured for routine delivery.
- Security workflows and scanners are required gates, not optional paths.

## Evidence commands

Use the same head SHA across all checks:

```bash
gh pr view <pr> \
  --json number,headRefOid,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup
gh pr checks <pr> --required
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/reviews
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<sha>/check-runs
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/rulesets --jq '.[] | {name, enforcement, rules}'
```

## Robot review versus GitHub approval

CodeRabbit review/check evidence satisfies this repo's preferred robot-review
path only after current-head blocking comments, pre-merge warnings, and failure
findings are resolved or superseded. When CodeRabbit evidence is absent, an
exact-current-head `APPROVED` review from the `opencode-agent` GitHub App may
satisfy the fallback path only with the structured adversarial evidence defined
above. A `github-actions` review or an overview comment is not authoritative App
approval. If GitHub reports a missing approving review despite valid robot
evidence, inspect the ruleset before waiting for a human review. The expected
setting is `required_approving_review_count=0`.

## Stale required contexts

A required context can become stale when the PR is fixing the workflow that
emits it. For example, PRs that fix Strix may be blocked by a required `strix`
context before the hardened Strix workflow can emit a valid result.

Handling policy:

1. Prefer branch update or rerun first.
2. If the required context cannot be emitted until the PR lands, document the
   stale context and use only a temporary, reversible ruleset adjustment.
   Capture equivalent temporary evidence before merge, such as a trusted-base
   rerun, scanner artifact, SARIF output, or manual security review evidence
   tied to the current head SHA.
3. Restore the `strix` required context after the hardened workflow emits it
   successfully on the protected branch.
4. Re-run required-check evidence after restore.

## PR #108/#109 evidence summary

- PR #108 exposed the merge-gate ambiguity: CodeRabbit/robot-review evidence was
  conflated with a GitHub `APPROVED` review, while ruleset configuration could
  still require human approval despite repo policy.
- Issue #109 documents the durable fix: distinguish robot-review evidence from
  GitHub approval objects, keep human approval count at zero, preserve review
  thread resolution, and handle stale `strix` required contexts with explicit
  rollback.
- The root cause was policy/evidence mismatch, not lack of human review.

## Rollback and recovery

- Do not add bypass actors, disable security checks, dismiss reviews, or use admin
  merge for normal delivery.
- Any temporary ruleset change must have captured before/after JSON, owner,
  expiry, head SHA, equivalent temporary evidence, and a named restore
  condition.
- Restore required contexts immediately after the repaired workflow emits them.
- If the platform still rejects merge after policy-aligned settings and passing
  checks, record the rejection as an external blocker with the exact command
  output and head SHA.
