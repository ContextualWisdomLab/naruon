# JSON formatter strict-validation doctoring

## Scope

Naruon exposes `json_formatter` as a workspace utility that accepts one JSON text, validates it, and returns the same data serialized with two-space indentation. The tool preserves non-ASCII text with `ensure_ascii=False`, preserves accepted JSON number tokens exactly, and applies the existing `ANALYSIS_TEXT_MAX_CHARS` ceiling to both source input and formatted-output construction. It is a deterministic utility; it does not invoke an LLM or infer semantics.

## Findings

The generated implementation used Python's default `json.loads()` / `json.dumps()` behavior. Python deliberately accepts the non-standard constants `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity` unless `parse_constant` rejects them, and its encoder emits those constants when `allow_nan=True` (the default). RFC 8259 section 6 does not permit Infinity or NaN in the JSON number grammar. A formatter advertised as a JSON validator therefore cannot accept those inputs and return text that is outside the interoperable JSON grammar.

A later exact-head audit found a second data-integrity boundary. Python's normal object decoding constructs a dictionary and therefore retains only one value when the same decoded member name occurs more than once. RFC 8259 section 4 says object member names SHOULD be unique and warns that receiver behavior is unpredictable when they are not: implementations may keep the last pair, reject the object, or expose every pair. A formatter that silently accepts `{\"id\":1,\"id\":2}` and returns only one `id` value has changed the user's data while presenting the result as validation/formatting. Naruon therefore rejects duplicate decoded member names rather than choosing first-wins or last-wins semantics.

A third exact-head audit found that valid-but-extremely-deep nesting can exceed the Python interpreter's recursion boundary before the existing 100,000-character ceiling is reached. In that case `json.loads()` raises `RecursionError`, while the formatter normalized only `JSONDecodeError` and `ValueError`. Direct invocation therefore leaked a different exception type, and the public `execute_tool` envelope returned the interpreter-specific recursion message instead of the formatter's deterministic `Invalid JSON string` contract. RFC 8259 section 9 explicitly permits implementations to limit maximum nesting depth, and the Python 3.14 JSON documentation states that the module is still subject to Python interpreter limits. This repair does not invent a new numerical nesting cap; it treats the interpreter-enforced boundary as a validation failure and normalizes it at the product boundary.

A fourth exact-head audit found a Unicode interoperability boundary. Python's decoder can materialize escaped unpaired UTF-16 surrogates such as `\ud800` or `\udc00` as Python strings. With `ensure_ascii=False`, `json.dumps()` can then return a Python string that still contains the surrogate even though the string cannot be encoded as strict UTF-8. That lets the formatter appear to succeed inside the handler and fail later at an HTTP or serialization boundary. RFC 8259 section 8.2 explicitly warns that unpaired surrogate values produce unpredictable cross-implementation behavior. The product boundary therefore requires the formatted result to be UTF-8 representable before returning success, while continuing to accept valid surrogate pairs that decode to ordinary Unicode scalar values such as `😀`.

A fifth exact-head audit found silent numeric-value corruption. Python's JSON decoder maps a real-number token to binary `float` by default. Valid inputs such as `0.123456789012345678901234567890`, `1e-400`, and `12345678901234567890.123456789` therefore round or underflow before the formatter serializes them again. Python 3.14 documents that `parse_float` and `parse_int` receive the original number token as a string and can return a custom type. RFC 8259 section 6 permits implementations to limit numeric range or precision for interoperability, but silently changing an accepted value is not a validation limit: it changes user data. Naruon now keeps each syntactically validated number token as an internal lexeme and emits that lexeme unchanged while only changing surrounding whitespace. Integer tokens still pass through Python's `int()` once so the interpreter's existing integer-string digit-limit defense is retained.

A sixth exact-head audit found formatted-output resource amplification. The source input was limited to 100,000 characters, but the recursive pretty-printer could repeat two-space indentation for every nested member and materialize a response many times larger than the accepted source. Exact RED `0845687e2fcba65d0af47443b1b106193900fa18` includes a deterministic 1,399-character JSON fixture whose pretty representation crosses the existing product ceiling at both the direct handler and public `execute_tool` boundary. A separate local reproduction of the same renderer semantics used a valid 6,799-character JSON with 400 nested arrays and 3,000 numeric leaves and produced 2,729,798 formatted characters; that measurement is supporting diagnosis, not acceptance evidence. OWASP API4:2023 identifies unbounded resource consumption, including memory/CPU and response-size work, as a denial-of-service and operational-cost risk. Naruon therefore reuses the existing product character ceiling as an incremental rendering budget rather than inventing a timeout, depth cap, or second size policy.

The generated feature was also followed by dependency/security commits that eventually removed the feature itself while leaving only frontend dependency changes in PR #1659. Those dependency files belong to canonical owner #1623. Ordinary adoption commit `66439fc025ded2bc185d4a19d70bb6c6bed2a3c8` preserves the generated history as first-parent provenance while adopting exact #1623 `17a7618eda2b212b691f08fa936e042b34258fc9` and its tree. No dependency source is owned by this product lane after that point.

## RED and causal fixes

Source-order RED `1b663b12f216ca3a5e201d9aee15da1ce1308065` restores the formatter on the canonical parent tree and adds focused tests for registry invocation, two-space formatting, Korean/Unicode preservation, malformed JSON syntax, the existing input-size ceiling, and rejection of `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`. The predecessor parser accepts the three non-finite literals, so those cases define the defect rather than a preferred implementation.

Causal fix `a8d4a0f157f1d540980adc933cc6038395511dbe` supplies `parse_constant` to reject Python's non-standard constants and sets `allow_nan=False` on serialization as a second fail-closed boundary. The public tool error remains deterministic (`Invalid JSON string`) instead of exposing parser-location details.

Source-order duplicate-member RED `83fcf7a81c436f3018886ff56cfaab130bc594ff` adds top-level and nested duplicate-name inputs plus the public `execute_tool` failure envelope. Under the predecessor implementation those inputs are accepted after an earlier member value is silently discarded.

Causal fix `3eb383487b5aed4ffdf48fbd588c2152aea02991` supplies `object_pairs_hook` and constructs each JSON object only after checking every decoded member name for prior occurrence. Because the hook is invoked for every object, the same rule applies to nested objects. Detection happens on decoded string names, so escape-spelling differences that decode to the same name do not evade the contract. Follow-up regression `3351cb2e2e4b56c75457c8b9bc25d08cd845071c` makes that decoded-name boundary executable with `"a"` and `"\u0061"` in the same object. The failure is normalized to `Invalid JSON string` at the public tool boundary.

Source-order recursion-boundary RED `1d92c268196d346aad957b528a261964e9bdcb4d` adds a deeply nested array whose source remains below `ANALYSIS_TEXT_MAX_CHARS`. It requires both direct handler invocation and the public execution envelope to fail with the same deterministic validation message. Under the predecessor implementation the decoder's `RecursionError` escapes the handler contract and the public envelope exposes an interpreter-specific message.

Causal fix `2b76321cc2d354c04d097ec4502777d8fa4838df` includes `RecursionError` in the same formatter validation boundary that already normalizes syntax and strictness failures. The commit briefly carried an unrelated `ToolCreate.category` description edit caused while replacing the source file; repair commit `cfd553e1c0dbce72a91232e00a4080da8d492e0f` restores that unrelated text without changing the recursion fix. The resulting product delta is therefore limited to the intended exception normalization plus its tests and doctoring.

Source-order surrogate RED `80745c3ca25e4194062dadf13d86f6783067643c` adds unpaired high-surrogate, unpaired low-surrogate, and surrogate-member-name inputs at both the direct handler and public `execute_tool` boundary. It also fixes the acceptance side of the contract by requiring the valid pair `\ud83d\ude00` to decode and format as `😀` rather than rejecting all surrogate escapes indiscriminately.

Causal fix `95facece4505db2992e6c69a173a4edb4dbc31dc` keeps `ensure_ascii=False` and validates the already formatted Python string with strict `formatted.encode("utf-8")`. `UnicodeEncodeError` is normalized through the existing `Invalid JSON string` boundary. This rejects values and object-member names that would later fail strict UTF-8 transport without changing ordinary Unicode preservation or valid surrogate-pair behavior.

Source-order numeric-integrity RED `ca5a7898e9c360babc2d95fe71163004203176ee` adds high-precision decimal, extreme-underflow exponent, negative-zero, large-decimal, public execution-envelope, ordinary scalar, and empty-container cases. The predecessor implementation changes multiple accepted number values because its default real-number path is binary `float`.

Causal fix `68bfdf0a12200989ee89031cc2ea5f90d36665ab` supplies `parse_float` and `parse_int` hooks that preserve validated number lexemes and replaces whole-value `json.dumps()` with a recursive presentation renderer. Strings and member names still use the standard JSON encoder; arrays and objects only gain two-space indentation; booleans and null retain their JSON literals. Integer preservation deliberately calls `int(value)` before retaining the lexeme so Python's existing maximum-integer-string conversion defense is not bypassed. The replacement operation accidentally changed `ToolUpdate.is_active` from an optional unset field to a default `True`; immediate repair `5cd989f5ef520d84818cfed07bbe5dcdf72aab1a` restores the prior partial-update semantics, and its commit diff contains only that one-line restoration.

Source-order output-amplification RED `0845687e2fcba65d0af47443b1b106193900fa18` adds direct-handler and public-execution regressions requiring valid sub-ceiling input to fail closed if its two-space pretty representation would exceed `ANALYSIS_TEXT_MAX_CHARS`. Causal fix `cea8b279366c8780f0beaf5eb2f3942560f231de` introduces one `_JsonSizeLimiter` shared through the recursive renderer. Each scalar, member prefix, separator, indentation segment, newline, and container delimiter is charged before the corresponding aggregate string can be returned; the renderer aborts during construction as soon as the existing ceiling would be exceeded. The direct handler preserves the product-specific `Formatted JSON must not exceed 100000 characters` error instead of normalizing that resource-limit result to `Invalid JSON string`, so `execute_tool` returns the same stable failure message. Numeric lexemes, duplicate-member rejection, non-finite rejection, recursion handling, strict UTF-8 validation, Unicode output, and the input-size contract are otherwise unchanged.

No arbitrary nesting, token, codepoint, number-range, retry, or timeout limit is introduced by these repairs.

## Rejected alternatives

- Treating Python's permissive non-finite defaults as valid JSON was rejected because it contradicts RFC 8259 interoperability syntax.
- String-searching for `NaN`, `Infinity`, duplicate member names, surrogate escape spellings, or numeric tokens was rejected because lexical search cannot distinguish strings from tokens or correctly interpret escaping and nesting.
- Keeping the first or last duplicate object member was rejected because either choice silently discards user input and different JSON implementations make different choices.
- Hard-coding a new nesting depth was rejected because the product already has an input-size ceiling and RFC 8259 allows implementation limits; the minimal defect is inconsistent failure normalization at the actual interpreter boundary.
- Switching the formatter to `ensure_ascii=True` was rejected because it would hide the transport defect by re-escaping all non-ASCII output and would change the existing Unicode-preservation contract.
- Rejecting every surrogate escape lexically was rejected because a valid pair such as `\ud83d\ude00` represents an ordinary Unicode scalar value after decoding and must remain accepted.
- Adding a product-specific Unicode codepoint allowlist was rejected because the defect is UTF-8 representability, not a need to redefine Unicode.
- Converting real numbers to `decimal.Decimal` and then normalizing their textual form was rejected because this utility promises formatting, not numeric canonicalization; preserving the validated token avoids both binary-float loss and unnecessary lexical rewriting.
- Bypassing `json.loads()` with a separate ad-hoc number tokenizer was rejected because the standard decoder already provides validated token hooks and the existing duplicate/non-finite contracts belong at that parser boundary.
- Rendering the full pretty string and checking its size afterward was rejected because the oversized allocation and CPU work would already have occurred; the resource ceiling belongs inside construction.
- Adding a guessed render timeout, a second output-size constant, or a shallower arbitrary depth cap was rejected because the existing product ceiling already expresses the required response-size boundary and can be enforced directly.
- Moving the frontend security bump into this PR was rejected because #1623 owns manifest/lock/security-floor truth.
- Reformatting keys or normalizing Unicode was rejected because the formatter should change presentation, not user data semantics.

## Acceptance boundary

The focused contract is GREEN only when the unchanged exact head executes `backend/tests/test_json_formatter_tool.py` together with the repository's normal backend checks. Acceptance includes malformed syntax, all three non-finite constants, top-level, nested, and escape-equivalent duplicate member names, recursion-limit nesting below the existing character ceiling, unpaired high/low surrogates in values and object member names, valid surrogate-pair preservation, exact preservation of accepted integer/fraction/exponent number tokens, high-precision and underflow cases, standard scalar and empty-container formatting, the public execution envelope, ordinary Unicode preservation, the input-size ceiling, and formatted-output amplification at both direct and public execution boundaries. The amplified-output case must abort while rendering and report `Formatted JSON must not exceed 100000 characters`; a completed oversized string followed by a length check does not satisfy the contract. A local parser or renderer probe can validate Python boundary behavior but is not a substitute for exact-head CI. Stacked-PR workflow evidence must remain bound to the actual repository, PR, base SHA, and head SHA; predecessor or pre-retarget receipts do not transfer.

This work does not claim complete JSON canonicalization. It preserves object insertion order and accepted numeric lexemes; canonical key ordering, Unicode normalization, schema validation, cryptographic signing, and a product-defined nesting-depth SLA remain separate contracts.
